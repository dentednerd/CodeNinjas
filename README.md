## Joey's notes

Properly updating the database with PATCH requests to the API? So much better than having to fake it with state.

Storybook? Love me a good Storybook. Developing components in isolation is very much my jam.

Stitches? That's tasty. Look at those super subtle colours. It's a very simple config, but so elegant. Shame that it's no longer maintained.

Atomic file structure? It just makes sense to me, and it works so well with Storybook, keeping components organised in an atomic hierarchy.

References to ninjas in pop culture? Can't help myself.
