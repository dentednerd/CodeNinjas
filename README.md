# Code Ninjas v1 (with original Redux setup)

Code Ninjas is an interactive web app, designed to teach JavaScript to kids aged 7 years and up. Answer questions and level up to become a fully fledged Code Ninja!

API: [live](https://codeninjas-api.fly.dev/), [repo](https://github.com/dentednerd/CodeNinjasBack)

## Requirements

- Node v8.4.0: [download](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Caution

The React app in this branch was _not_ created with `create-react-app`. It uses older versions of React and Redux that might be unstable on your system, particularly if using a newer version of Node. You might have a better time with the `version-1` branch of this repo, which has been updated to use a  later version of React and removes Redux entirely.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dentednerd/CodeNinjas.git
cd CodeNinjas
npm i
```

## Usage

```sh
npm start
```

## Joey's notes

Goodness, how far we've come.

You know how I said in my [Github profile](https://github.com/dentednerd) that you should ask me about React hooks? This reminds me why I love them so much. Old school React was messy.

I don't like to think about Redux for the same reason.

I wonder what the rest of TeamJSKids is up to these days...
